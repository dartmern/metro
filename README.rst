you have any questions please join my `support server <https://discord.gg/2ceTMZ9qJh>`_
and ping `dartmern#7563` with your questions.

Self-hosting
---------------

As of the latest release I am not supporting or endorsing 
you self hosting a copy of my bot. The licenses and code is here
for reference and this just isn't supported at this time. I would prefer
if you called the invite command and use the bot that way.

You can do whatever you want with this information but self-hosting
support will not be given nor instructions on how to.
